Feynman followed Hans Bethe , instead , to Cornell University , where Feynman taught theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950 . During a temporary depression following the destruction of Hiroshima by the bomb produced by the Manhattan Project , he focused on complex physics problems , not for utility , but for self - satisfaction . One of these was analyzing the physics of a twirling , nutating dish as it is moving through the air . His work during this period , which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds , proved important to his Nobel Prize – winning work , yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems , he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities .'"

Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki , grilled octopus and small fish , feta cheese , dolmades ( rice , currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves ) , various pulses , olives and cheese .
